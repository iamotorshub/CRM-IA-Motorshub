You are a senior full-stack TypeScript engineer and software architect.

You are inside my project **CRM-IA-Motorshub / Aura CRM** running on Replit.

I just ran the dev script and got:
- `rest-express@1.0.0 dev`
- `[express] serving on port 5000`
- A PostCSS warning, but the server is running.

====================================================
YOUR JOB IN THIS PASS
====================================================

1) ANALYZE THE PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Scan the repo and tell me:
     - What stack is used on the frontend (React? Vite? Tailwind?).
     - What stack is used on the backend (Express? any ORM?).
     - What the main entrypoints are (server index, main React file, etc.).
   - Identify existing domain entities related to:
     - contacts / leads
     - campaigns
     - properties / real estate (if any)

   Return a structured summary with:
   - frontend_stack
   - backend_stack
   - database_or_persistence
   - important_modules
   - routing_and_layout
   - current_domain_entities
   - rough_mental_model (1–2 paragraphs explaining how the app currently works end-to-end).

2) RUN / DEV INSTRUCTIONS
   - Confirm which commands are used to:
     - Install dependencies.
     - Start the dev server(s).
   - List any required environment variables by NAME only (e.g. DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) and where they should live (.env, .env.local).
   - Explain how, in Replit, I should run the app and what URL/path to open in the browser.

3) GAP ANALYSIS FOR MY GOALS
   My main goals for this project are:
   - Lead Engine:
     - Import leads from CSV/Excel into a normalized contacts model.
     - Prepare for lead scoring and segmentation.
   - Campaign Engine (Email first, WhatsApp second):
     - Create campaigns and steps.
     - Store subject + body templates.
     - Later, generate copy with AI.

   Based on the current code, tell me:
   - What already exists that relates to leads / contacts / campaigns.
   - What is still missing for:
     - v1 Lead Engine.
     - v1 Campaign Engine (email only).

   Return:
   - existing_features
   - missing_pieces_for_lead_engine
   - missing_pieces_for_campaign_engine

4) PROPOSE A 3-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (NO CODE YET)
   - Phase 1: Make Lead Engine v1 real (CSV import + contacts view).
   - Phase 2: Campaign Builder v1 (email).
   - Phase 3: AI hooks for generating email copy (no provider hardcoded).

   For each phase, give:
   - 4–7 bullet points of concrete tasks.
   - Files likely to be touched.
   - “Done when…” simple criteria.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT modify any files yet.
- First, just analyze and return the summary + plan.
- Keep responses concise but rich and actionable.
